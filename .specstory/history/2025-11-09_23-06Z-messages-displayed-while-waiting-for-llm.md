Found the messages. They're in `templates/index.html` in a JavaScript array called `funnyMessages`. They rotate every 2.5 seconds while waiting for the LLM.

```96:117:templates/index.html
  const funnyMessages = [
    "It's better to wait a few seconds than sign a bad contract...",
    "Reading fine print so you don't have to...",
    "Checking if the landlord is trying to pull a fast one...",
    "Counting the ways this contract could go wrong...",
    "Looking for loopholes like a contract detective...",
    "Reviewing clauses with the intensity of a legal eagle...",
    "Making sure you're not signing your life away...",
    "Double-checking that 'reasonable' actually means reasonable...",
    "Ensuring the small print isn't hiding anything fun...",
    "Verifying that 'standard terms' are actually standard...",
    "Cross-referencing with the checklist of doom...",
    "Making sure the rent isn't going to the moon...",
    "Checking if termination clauses are actually fair...",
    "Reviewing faster than a lawyer charges per hour...",
    "Ensuring your deposit won't mysteriously disappear...",
    "Looking for red flags like a contract bloodhound...",
    "Making sure 'flexible terms' aren't just marketing speak...",
    "Checking that notice periods make actual sense...",
    "Verifying the contract isn't written in invisible ink...",
    "Ensuring you're not agreeing to clean the landlord's car..."
  ];
```

They rotate via this code:

```133:136:templates/index.html
    messageInterval = setInterval(() => {
      messageIndex = (messageIndex + 1) % funnyMessages.length;
      loadingMessage.textContent = funnyMessages[messageIndex];
    }, 2500);
```

There are 20 messages that cycle every 2.5 seconds while the review is processing.
